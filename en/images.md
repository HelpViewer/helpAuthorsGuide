# üñºÔ∏è Images

You can insert images to chapter text this way:

```markdown
![description if image doesn't exists](path/to/image.png "Bubble hint description")
```

There can be 2 types of path to image file:
  - local inside the help file:  
    ```
    path/to/image.png
    ```
  - or remote:  
    ```
    https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214681531?s=200&v=4
    ```

Example:

![description if image doesn't exists](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214681531?s=200&v=4 "Bubble hint description")

![description if image doesn't exists (local image from given help file)](_icon.png "local image from given help file")
