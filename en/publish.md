# ðŸ“¦ Publishing of help file

ðŸ’¡ Recommendation:
- If you don't know **Git**, check out its [documentation][GitRef].

âœ… Entry conditions / Prerequisites:
- Make sure you have a [ðŸ”‘ PAT Token][PATToken] properly linked to the help repository that has not expired. If the token is not valid, the release script will fail.

The simplified procedure for issuing a hint can be summarised as follows:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Go to your repository
3. Add all your unmerged changes:
```
git add .
```
4. Merge the changes into the repository:
```
git commit -m "Help file changes"
```
"Help file changes" - any of your descriptive messages can be here

5. Make a change to the **CHANGELOG.md** file at the root of the repository so that the beginning of the file looks like:
```
# Changelog

## YMD
- My changes
```

kde:

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| YMD | the date will be in 202050622 format (year, month and day without separators) |
| My changes | Write down your change descriptions |

6. Merge the changes into the repository:
```
git commit -m "Help file changes [pub]"
```
- "Help file changes" - any of your descriptive messages can be here
- **[pub]** in the message text is required to run the release script

7. Merge your version into the GitHub server:
```
git push
```

The release script is then run. 

The result will be an edition with attachments:
- Help-(language short code).zip (for each individual language)
- Help-.zip (for [custom Viewer UI][CustomUI])

[PATToken]: token.md "GitHub PAT token"
[CustomUI]: customUI.md "Custom Viewer UI"
