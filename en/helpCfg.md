# üõ†Ô∏è Help configuration

You can change help configuration in file **_config.txt**. File is located in language version subdir. Each language has its own independent copy.

File structure is:

```
key|value
key|value
```

## Rules

- 1 row = one value
- If the same key will repeat later in the file, the last one value will be used

## Configuration keys
