## Position description

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| [1] | One space = one sublevel (plunge). No spaces = main level |
| [2] | Title of the item in the tree |
| [3] | Hint bubble text when hovering over an item |
| [4] | Empty or valid relative path to the image to be attached to the left side of the item |
| [5] | The relative path of the target file with the chapter content or special names below |

### Position [5]: special names

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| =latestApp | Looks up the URI for the latest version of HelpViewer |
| =latestHelp | Looks up the URI for the latest version of the help file (if the repository is hosted on GitHub as public) |
| :(...) | The system takes the relative path from the application data, not the help. At this point, **viewRepo.htm** is the only appropriate value. |
| ~~ | If these characters appear anywhere in the path, they will be replaced by the version of the open help package. |
