# ðŸ”— Links in texts

- Two underscores (**__**) represents the selected language, which the system automatically adds from the user settings.
- Refer to documents in relative ways (using ..). 
- Use **forward - /** for slashes in path strings.
- For more complex links (going to another help), use **?** and enter only parameters to make the system transfer easier in the future

See below for common ways to define a link.
