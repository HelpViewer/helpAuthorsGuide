# ðŸ“„ New chapter

- You will define new chapter in your help by creating a new **md** or **htm** file.
  - Follow the standard document syntax for these formats ([md][MDSyntax], [HTML 5][HTML5Syntax]).
  - In HTML files write only content of **body** tag, but without body and surrounding tags to keep result HTML output compliant with **W3C** standard.
- Currently **HelpViewer** has no editor of its own. For efficient writing, I recommend using **WYSIWYG** editors.

- For **md** files e.g.:
  - [Editor.md][MDE-1]
  - [stackedit.io][MDE-2]
  - [Toast UI editor][MDE-3]  
  (all of these works offline in your web browser)

- For **htm** files e.g.:
  - [VS Codium][HTM-1]
  - [Geany][HTM-3]
  - [PSPad][HTM-2]  
  (after an installation all of these works locally as a desktop version)

- Write the files in these editors, then download their source and save them in the help repository folder.
- Editors can also occasionally fail and lose your parsed text. Therefore, copy the text to your disk over time.
